# Hello, I'm Cooper Simpson

I am currently a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC), working with Alireza Doostan and Stephen Becker. I recieved my B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2019 and 2022 respectively from CU.

Broadly, my research interests are in computational and mathematical science. I have worked in areas such as non-convex optimization, deep learning, data compression, and algorithmic economics.
