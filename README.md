# Hello, I'm Cooper Simpson

Since 2024, I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I am advised by Alexsandr Aravkin. I am also a 2025 recipient of the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF).

Prior to this I...
- Worked as a professional research assistant in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC) at the University of Colorado Boulder from 2022-2024, where I collaborated with Alireza Doostan and Stephen Becker on data compression techniques for large-scale scientific simulations.
- Earned my B.S. and M.S. from CU Boulder in Applied Mathematics in 2020 and 2022 respectively, where I was advised by Stephen Becker for my masters thesis on non-convex Newton-type optimization methods.

Broadly, my research interests are in computational and mathematical science. I have worked in areas such as non-convex optimization, deep learning, data compression, and algorithmic economics. I appreciate both the theory and application side of problems, which is to say I enjoy both proving a theorem and programming a software package.
