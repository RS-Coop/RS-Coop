# Hello, I'm Cooper Simpson

I am currently a professional research assistant at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC). I work with Alireza Doostan and Stephen Becker on data compression techniques for large-scale scientific simulations. I also work independently with Stephen Becker on non-convex Newton-type optimization methods. I recieved my B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2020 and 2022 respectively from CU.

Broadly, my research interests are in computational and mathematical science. I have worked in areas such as non-convex optimization, deep learning, data compression, and algorithmic economics. I appreciate both the theory and application side of problems, which is to say I enjoy both proving a theorem and programming a software package.
